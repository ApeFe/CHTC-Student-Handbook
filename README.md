# CHTC-Student-Handbook
A small handbook to help complete tasks for CHTC (Student) Employees. Also contains a list of server locations.

The handbook comes in 2 versions, a PDF and TXT file.

* The PDF updates are to be pushed to github on a monthly basis, so they won't
necessarily be updated to the bleeding edge, but they are the most readable.

* Changes to the TXT version are pushed to github as soon as they are made.

---

There is also a node_locations.txt files - This just contains the locations
of execute nodes (and a few others) that the CHTC manages. Useful for finding
a server that breaks.
