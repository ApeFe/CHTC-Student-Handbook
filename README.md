# CHTC-Student-Handbook
A small handbook to help complete tasks for CHTC (Student) Employees. Also contains a list of server locations.

The handbook comes in 2 versions, a PDF and TXT file.

* The PDF updates are to be pushed to github on a monthly basis, so they won't
necessarily be updated to the bleeding edge, but they are the most readable.

* Changes to the TXT version are pushed to github as soon as they are made.

---

There is also a node_locations.txt files - This just contains the locations
of execute nodes (and a few others) that the CHTC manages. Useful for finding
a server that breaks.

---
### Finished
* Update the node locations files and chart in the handbook
* Node rebuild how-to.

### TODO
* Finish the CHTC Student Handbook
  * Building a New Node
  * Decommissioning a Node
  * Creating Tickets
  * Checking for Errors
  * Advanced Topics
* Add the txt version from the gdoc.

### Contributing
Contributing is easy. If you want to make an edit to the guide the easiest way
is to fork this repository, make the relevant changes to the TXT version of the
guide or another file, and submit a pull request. Check out [github's guide to
contributing](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).

You can also open any issues that you see in the github issue tracker, and feel
free to submit pull requests to fix issues that are listed. Thanks!

If you want to edit the PDF version, you can make a copy of the Google Doc, make
your changes to it, save it locally as a PDF, and then submit a pull request
with the new PDF. I'll take a look at merging those changes into future releases.
